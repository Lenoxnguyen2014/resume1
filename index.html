				Hi,<br>

				I am writing this email to apply for the internship position at VIVONET. My program is computer information technology.<br>  
				I only start coding when I got accepted to BCIT. First, the program is quite challenging as I have to take 7 courses. Therefore, there are some moments that I felt overwhelmed. However, the more I study and invest my time in coding, the better problem-solving skills I develop. For example, when I first took COMP 1409 last term, I thought I would fail because I did not learn Java before. The class is about software development which is about the foundation of Java. I could not catch up so I submitted my labs late all the time. However, I found a new studying habit as I talked more to my classmates, and had more group study. I start progressing. Therefore, I passed the course at the end. Java is a new computer language for me. It was challenging in the beginning.<br>
				I believe that everything is possible. If I fail at something, the reason is that I do not know how to do that. However, if I keep being patient and learn from my mistake, I will progress well.<br>

 				Learning and working at BCIT would be a nice experience while I am studying abroad. Yet, I am still on my long journey to graduate. Therefore, I am looking for a new experience. I am really eager to work at VIVONET. Please let me know as soon as possible.<br>

				Sincerely,<br>
				Le
